        <blockquote>At this time of writing, I have known and had the pleasure of working with Kenny for just over a year. He literally stepped into the light and assisted in the rescue of a project that was on the verge of being cancelled due to all manner of issues. Quoting Wikipedia:
Integrity is a concept of consistency of actions, values, methods, measures, principles, expectations, and outcomes. In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Taking the full measure of the man, I can honestly say that Kenny symbolizes the meaning of that word - Integrity. I have â€º only respect, admiration and gratitude for his respectful attitude towards his colleagues as well as his leadership abilities and would gladly recommend him for any project that he wishes to pursue!
